# JavaScript Reading
##First Chapter
### What I Knew
I'm pretty familiar with JavaScript basics, like Boolean values and strings
### What I Didn't
I didn't realize that NaN (not a number) was not equal to itself. It is a condition, not a value. This ties in with my new knowledge of how JavaScript tries to convert values to things you don't expect if you're not specific.
##Second Chapter
### What I Knew
In addition to the capitalism I remember a couple of the functions and bindings they talk about, like variables, console.log, if/else and for statments. Some of the more sophisticated ones that do similar things, like let and while, I didn't know about.
### What I Didn't
The section about loops was particularly helpful for me, as I didn't really understand how that worked before, especially in the context of when statments and prompts.
## Third Chapter
### What I Knew
I'll be honest, I didn't know a lot from this chapter and I'm still kind of confused.
### What I Didn't
Like I said I didn't really get this at all, I would need to actually code some of this to understand what they're saying.
