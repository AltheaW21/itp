# JavaScript Reading
##First Chapter
### What I Knew
I'm pretty familiar with JavaScript basics, like Boolean values and strings
### What I Didn't
I didn't realize that NaN (not a number) was not equal to itself. It is a condition, not a value. This ties in with my new knowledge of how JavaScript tries to convert values to things you don't expect if you're not specific.
