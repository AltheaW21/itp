# Final Project Proposal

My final project is going to be a revision of a project I did in Orca for my Intro to Sound Design Class. In that project, I coded the first five modules of Terry Riley's "In C", which controlled MIDI instruments in Logic, and made another module that randomly generated eastward moving operators to randomly trigger the different pitch modules. My goal for the final project is to have this project follow the instructions piece more literally, by making it dependent on an earlier module to start before the next module comes in, and stopping the earlier modules at random times as well. 

My original code can be found in this folder.
