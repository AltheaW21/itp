# Python Reading
## Chapter 1
### Thing I knew
The intro on programming was kind of review from Javascript, but very good and necessary review!
### Thing I did not know
I am completely new to Python, so everything about the syntax was all new information to me. The bit about formal versus natural languages was also very interesting!
## Chapter 3
### Thing I knew
Dot notation and defining functions are both things that I learned about through SuperCollider. They work a little differently in Python, but I already knew that defining functions in order is very important.
### Thing I did not know
I  had to read the subchapter about Math Functions a couple of different times. Floating point numbers were confusing to me, but I learned that they're an approximation of a number with infinite values. For example a floating point version of 1/3 would be 0.334, because it's a limited bit version of the actual number.
## Chapter 5
### Thing I knew
I knew about boolean operators and all the math functions that were talked about it, but this was a good review of how they're different in Python.
### Thing I did not know
When recursion was explained to me, I didn't really understand it. This chapter did a really good job of explaining it however, and this taught me how it can be useful in creating functions that gnereate different results until the final result is reached.
## Chapter 10
### Thing I knew
A lot of the information about lists is pretty self explanatory
### Thing I did not know
The information about .split and other list operators was very helpful and interesting! I didn't know you could divide a list of strings into different words and characters.
