altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro ~ %`
I initialized terminal
`altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd Documents                        
altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro Documents % cd GitHub
altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro GitHub % pwd
/Users/altheawincek/Documents/GitHub`
Afterwards, I directed myself to Documents and Github and checked where I was. I was in the correct place.
`altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro GitHub % cd itp
altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro itp % haiku
zsh: command not found: haiku`
I then attempted to navigate to the itp folder and the haiku folder within, but I forgot the command 'cd' before navigating to the Haiku folder.
`altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro itp % cd haiku
altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro haiku % pwd
/Users/altheawincek/Documents/GitHub/itp/haiku`
I resolved the previous issue.
`altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro haiku % say "there was an old lady who swallowed a fly, I don't know why, she swallowed a fly." -o haiku.aiff 
altheawincek@Altheas-MacBook-Pro haiku %`
Finally, I input the command to create my aiff file, and pressed 'return'.
