The first thing I did for this assignment was create a css file. To make this file, I used the tutorial on [https://www.w3schools.com/](W3 Schools.) Unfortuneatly, this had me doing things that should've been going into my html file in my css file instead. I remedied this with a quick copy and paste later in this process. 

Using the aforementioned tutorial, we decided on making our background color "Olive Drab," and Ian chose all of the fonts that we used for the headers and paragraphs. While everyone was writing their individual bios for our new "Latin-Funk-Electronic-Rock band" (genres decided by Pepe), I made up a quick bio for the band and wrote it out. This whole time I was writing in html syntax within a css file. Around this point, Arnie pointed out that the css file should've been a lot shorter than it was, and I copied the html parts into my index.html file.

After this debocle was solved, I had each member choose an image to be associated with their bio, and put them in my github folder, uploading them to our site with the `<img src>` syntax. 

Around here, I realized there was a 404 message each time I tried to open our site. I realized this was because I tried to rename the repository to something more consistent with our band's name, which you can't do, as you pointed out. We changed the name of the repository back to my username, and all was fine and good in the world again.

Our next task was putting in our hyperlink, which links to Never Gonna Give You Up. Classic. The syntax for this was `<a href="link">text</a>`, which Arnie found.

We then added alt text. I found the syntax for this by looking at the html file of the example webiste. The syntax is `<img src="name of image" alt="alt text">`
